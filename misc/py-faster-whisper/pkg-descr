ster-whisper is a reimplementation of OpenAI's Whisper model using CTranslate2,
which is a fast inference engine for Transformer models.

This implementation is up to 4 times faster than openai/whisper for the same
accuracy while using less memory. The efficiency can be further improved with
8-bit quantization on both CPU and GPU.
